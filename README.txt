Experimental engine for low latency, high fps multiplayer games.

Motivated by es_core (https://github.com/TTimo/es_core,
https://ttimo.typepad.com/blog/2013/05/es_core-an-experimental-framework-for-low-latency-high-fps-multiplayer-games.html).

This project is a playground for ideas in game networking, deterministic simulation, low-latency
input handling, and global illumination shader experimentation — all while keeping the fun and
energy of classic arena shooters like Unreal Tournament.

This is a work-in-progress side project, developed in my spare time and continuously evolving.
Expect rapid iterations, occasional breaking changes, and experimental ideas.

Feedback, ideas, and contributions are very welcome — whether you're a game engine hobbyist,
competitive FPS player, or engineer passionate about latency and control.
